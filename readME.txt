MEAN Stack Hackathon (4 Days)

This is my first solo project.

Project Goals:

To create a web application called ReadIt.
ReadIt is a place for aspiring scholars to achieve badges based on self-reported completions of recommended books in each category.
Readers can review the books, unlock forums discussing books, and share their badges on their LinkedIn accounts to show-off their book repertoire. Readers will get ranked based on community participation. Readers can plan regional book-club meet-ups through ReadIt to connect with others who are interested in similar topics.
